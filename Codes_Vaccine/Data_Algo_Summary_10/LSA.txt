I believe it should be mandatory with exceptions given for those who have legitimate, recorded medical reasons to refuse vaccinations

So, instead of their being a law somehow written that forces vaccinations, life should be made more difficult for those who actively refuse with no medical excuse

Its almost unbelievable that other diseases like Measles are starting to outbreak because of this same mentality

One, many children are required to be vaccinated when they enter school for a variety of other illnesses

Another reason is that COVID has made such a significant impact on society over the past few years

People should be allowed to deny the vaccine if they don’t feel it is safe or studied enough yet

This new Covid-19 vaccine should be no different, given how it was rigorously tested by medical professionals and passed all FDA requirements

Furthermore, enacting a required vaccination policy may provide practical issues, such as how to enforce it and handle vaccine exemptions

Plus, the amount of people who have died after getting it with heart problems is entirely too many

It’s wrong to force any type of medical treatment on someone, and I think that people should have the choice
