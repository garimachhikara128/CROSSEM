Yes, It is in the interest of the public to keep people safe

Covid-19 vaccination should most definitely be mandatory

I believe it should be mandatory with exceptions given for those who have legitimate, recorded medical reasons to refuse vaccinations

So, instead of their being a law somehow written that forces vaccinations, life should be made more difficult for those who actively refuse with no medical excuse

It's not possible to know the long term effects of these drugs and its immoral to enforce a mandatory vaccine rule

Not only should covid vaccines not be made mandatory, they should be stopped immediately

This new Covid-19 vaccine should be no different, given how it was rigorously tested by medical professionals and passed all FDA requirements

I absolutely do not believe the covid-19 "vaccines" should be made mandatory

I personally was vaccinated and became quite ill with Omicron nonetheless, as did many others I know

Only gives the possibility of lesser symptoms
