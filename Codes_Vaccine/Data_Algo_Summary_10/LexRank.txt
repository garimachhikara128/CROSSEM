I believe it should be mandatory with exceptions given for those who have legitimate, recorded medical reasons to refuse vaccinations

Covid-19 vaccinations should NOT be made mandatory, First of all we don't know the long term effects of the vaccine

People would NOT stand for it and they know that, There is also side effects from the Covid-19 vaccination so in reality if it was forced on the public it could do more harm then good

People who have been vaccinated have caught Covid due only to the selfish people who do not think they need to get vaccinated

I think Covid vaccines should be mandatory because it is a matter of public health

I do not think the vaccines should be made mandatory

The vaccines are not safe for people with certain pre-existing conditions and have been linked to ill effects in some people

A vaccination shouldn't be forced upon anyone as if they don't have freedom of will to decide what does or doesn't get injected into their system

I do not think that Covid-19 vaccination should be mandatory

The vaccine is about as effective (if not less) as a flu shot
