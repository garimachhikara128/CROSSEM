Yes, It is in the interest of the public to keep people safe

As a result, it will continue to kill thousands to millions of people each year

While I support getting the vaccination, which I have, I have my doubts this will go away and will be something we live with moving forward

Covid-19 vaccinations should NOT be made mandatory, First of all we don't know the long term effects of the vaccine

It's not possible to know the long term effects of these drugs and its immoral to enforce a mandatory vaccine rule

If it's for the better toward the well-being of a bigger population, there should be no questions if it should be mandatory or not

covid -19 vaccination should be voluntary, my body my choice

Vaccination requirements are nothing new and have been in place for decades

It is not reasonable, in my opinion, to force everyone to take the vaccine regardless of their personal health, circumstances, and beliefs

There also is not enough research of the long term effects of this vaccine
