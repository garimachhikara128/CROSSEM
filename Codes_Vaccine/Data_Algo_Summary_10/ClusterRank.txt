I think instead of mandatory vaccination, trying to educate the public on the benefits for those who really need it, and providing further education on keeping ourselves healthy and less susceptible to the illness would be good as well; this should begin at the primary school level

Rather than depending simply on a mandated vaccination program, governments and public health experts may find it advantageous to investigate a variety of measures, such as educational campaigns and incentives to encourage vaccination

Its absolutely not fair to those people who have done their duty as a human being to end up in the hospital due to the fact that a lot of people think they are better than everyone else in this country and remain unvaccinated

Without the vaccine we would probably still have random lockdowns, businesses closing because most of the staff is sick and even having trouble retaining of hiring staff because people do not want to be exposed to the virus

On the one hand, vaccinations are a successful method of preventing the spread of infectious illnesses, and Covid-19 immunization in particular has the potential to aid in pandemic control and protect vulnerable people

Also, looking into the vaccination it isnt even a full immunity just something that makes covid weaker, which if people know Biology that only makes the virus stronger due to it being able to grow and adapt

Making vaccination mandatory might assist guarantee that enough individuals are vaccinated to develop herd immunity, protecting others who are unable to obtain the vaccine due to medical reasons

People would NOT stand for it and they know that, There is also side effects from the Covid-19 vaccination so in reality if it was forced on the public it could do more harm then good

Even now in 2023 when the world, or at least the USA, thinks it is mostly 'under control', we have another outbreak in China and a massive struggle for the government to contain it

Losing 1-3% of your population doesn't sound like a lot, but that depopulates the workforce so quickly that it interrupts the supply chain and creates all sorts of logical issues
