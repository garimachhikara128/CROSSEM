Yes, It is in the interest of the public to keep people safe

Covid-19 vaccines should not be made mandatory in any way

So, instead of their being a law somehow written that forces vaccinations, life should be made more difficult for those who actively refuse with no medical excuse

People would NOT stand for it and they know that, There is also side effects from the Covid-19 vaccination so in reality if it was forced on the public it could do more harm then good

I think it's a great overreach of power to do so

It's not possible to know the long term effects of these drugs and its immoral to enforce a mandatory vaccine rule

There are clear signs of how the vaccine has positive benefits presently/future

Making vaccination mandatory might assist guarantee that enough individuals are vaccinated to develop herd immunity, protecting others who are unable to obtain the vaccine due to medical reasons

We need to not support government overreach

The vaccine shout be mandatory because it will save lives
