yes, it should

If it's for the better toward the well-being of a bigger population, there should be no questions if it should be mandatory or not

No it should not be

People should be able to make their own choices

Autonomy is a huge part of being an American citizen

The vaccines are new and not enough long term studies have been done

People should be allowed to deny the vaccine if they donâ€™t feel it is safe or studied enough yet

It should not be forced on people

covid -19 vaccination should be voluntary, my body my choice

I believe it should be mandatory
