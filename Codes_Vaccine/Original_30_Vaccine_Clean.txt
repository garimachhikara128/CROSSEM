Yes, It is in the interest of the public to keep people safe

Anti vaccera are just selfish individuals

We need to help each other rise above this current crisis

Covid-19 vaccination should most definitely be mandatory

Like influenza, it will continue to mutate into new forms

As a result, it will continue to kill thousands to millions of people each year

Objectors contend that a vaccination won't prevent them from catching the coronavirus

While correct, that isn't the point of a vaccination

The point is to reduce the severity of the disease, making it more likely that the recipient will live and not put a strain on the local healthcare system

Covid-19 vaccines should not be made mandatory in any way

First of all, these are our bodies, we choose what goes in them

The ingredients in any vaccine are deemed unsafe

There is a vaccine court where the injured or deceased get paid

Vaccines kill, but I am all about choice

It's hard to say, some people do react poorly to it myself included

It's seemingly becoming similar to the flu where it's something that is seemingly only necessary for those at risk such as the elderly or those with auto-immune deficiencies

I personally don't get flu shots nor do I get it more than once every several years

I'm unsure it's at the point where mandatory vaccination would eradicate COVID-19, and the logistics of trying to accomplish something like that seems difficult to put it lightly

While I support getting the vaccination, which I have, I have my doubts this will go away and will be something we live with moving forward

I think instead of mandatory vaccination, trying to educate the public on the benefits for those who really need it, and providing further education on keeping ourselves healthy and less susceptible to the illness would be good as well; this should begin at the primary school level

I believe it should be mandatory with exceptions given for those who have legitimate, recorded medical reasons to refuse vaccinations

Individuals have an obligation to their society, and refusal of vaccinations for flimsy political and religious excuses are harmful to society at large and deeply selfish

That being said, I do have some apprehensions towards making any medical decision mandatory

So, instead of their being a law somehow written that forces vaccinations, life should be made more difficult for those who actively refuse with no medical excuse

Public schooling should be inaccessible, health insurance should be more expensive, etc

So if someone values their 'freedom' more than they value these basic amenities, let them die on that hill, so to speak

People who would sacrifice human lives for their own comfort do not deserve to reap the rewards of those who make sacrifices for others

Covid-19 vaccinations should NOT be made mandatory, First of all we don't know the long term effects of the vaccine

The vaccination does not even seem effective

I know many people who received the COVID-19 vaccination and they still ended up getting the Covid-19 virus

I also feel like the government CDC, FDA, WHO just cant go and force you to get the Covid-19 vaccinations

People would NOT stand for it and they know that, There is also side effects from the Covid-19 vaccination so in reality if it was forced on the public it could do more harm then good

It's at the point where Covid vaccination needs to become mandatory

New variants seem to appear daily

People who have been vaccinated have caught Covid due only to the selfish people who do not think they need to get vaccinated

Its absolutely not fair to those people who have done their duty as a human being to end up in the hospital due to the fact that a lot of people think they are better than everyone else in this country and remain unvaccinated

Its almost unbelievable that other diseases like Measles are starting to outbreak because of this same mentality

It's irresponsible, and downright evil to live in a world and not want to protect other human beings

I don't believe the government should be able to force me to inject anything into my body for any reason

I think it's a great overreach of power to do so

I don't think the vaccines have been studied long enough or thoroughly enough to convince me they're harmless

It's not possible to know the long term effects of these drugs and its immoral to enforce a mandatory vaccine rule

Nobody should have that much power in a free country,  ever

Overall, I am leaning towards the COVID vaccination being mandatory for a couple of reasons

One, many children are required to be vaccinated when they enter school for a variety of other illnesses

If that is the case, then a COVID vaccine should also be considered mandatory

Another reason is that COVID has made such a significant impact on society over the past few years

In addition, people continue to die from COVID every day, and there remains thousands of people in the hospital who have COVID

Mandating a COVID vaccination would almost eliminate the endemic nature of COVID

However I am concerned about the political and moral ramifications of mandating the vaccination because mandating is a strong solution

yes, it should

If it's for the better toward the well-being of a bigger population, there should be no questions if it should be mandatory or not

No it should not be

People should be able to make their own choices

Autonomy is a huge part of being an American citizen

The vaccines are new and not enough long term studies have been done

People should be allowed to deny the vaccine if they don’t feel it is safe or studied enough yet

It should not be forced on people

covid -19 vaccination should be voluntary, my body my choice

I believe it should be mandatory

Things in life are made to help people

The government isn't trying to oppress you

They want it's citizens to be healthy

From an economic stand point, it's probably more expensive to provide hospital care to a sick person than it is to provide a vaccine

I'm sure if there was a vaccine for cancer the public opinion would change

I could see people rushing to get vaccinated for that

Yes, I feel that it's proven to be effective and safe

There are clear signs of how the vaccine has positive benefits presently/future

It's irresponsible to not be vaccinated

It's free and easy to do

It helps protects those who are most vulnerable and it's just another shot like any other

There is no difference than getting shots when you're a kid so its really not a big deal

I think Covid vaccines should be mandatory because it is a matter of public health

The same way you stop at a stop sign in order to prevent a dangerous situation for you or others - the vaccination is designed to protect yourself as well as the public around you

You need to think about more than yourself when making decisions

Not only should covid vaccines not be made mandatory, they should be stopped immediately

They have been shown to be the cause of many illnesses and deaths

There has been so much deception surrounding this shot

Generating fear and threatening the jobs of people just to force them to get a shot is not only unconstitutional, its criminal

Because it put people's lives in danger

Whoever forced this medical experiment on others against their will without full disclosure and consent should be punished and held accountable, so it doesn't happen again

Covid-19 is pretty deadly

People forget just how much of the world's population died of it, especially in the initial stages in China and in large population clusters and cities in the world

It was wreaking Havoc

Losing 1-3% of your population doesn't sound like a lot, but that depopulates the workforce so quickly that it interrupts the supply chain and creates all sorts of logical issues

Even now in 2023 when the world, or at least the USA, thinks it is mostly 'under control', we have another outbreak in China and a massive struggle for the government to contain it

The vaccines have been proven effective to reduce the fatalities

People can still get sick, but so long as they survive, that's the key function of the vaccines

Turn it from a killer back to the flu like symptoms

I think the Covid-19 vaccine should be made mandatory with only a few medical and approved exceptions

Vaccination requirements are nothing new and have been in place for decades

They are necessary to attend public schools, work for certain companies, join the military, etc

This new Covid-19 vaccine should be no different, given how it was rigorously tested by medical professionals and passed all FDA requirements

Although we do not know the potential future drawbacks, this can be said for a variety of things, including many foods we eat and many products we use

Furthermore, we have already seen its efficacy and most medical professionals believe its positives (saving millions of lives) outweigh its potential negatives

On the one hand, vaccinations are a successful method of preventing the spread of infectious illnesses, and Covid-19 immunization in particular has the potential to aid in pandemic control and protect vulnerable people

Making vaccination mandatory might assist guarantee that enough individuals are vaccinated to develop herd immunity, protecting others who are unable to obtain the vaccine due to medical reasons

Mandating vaccination, on the other hand, violates the notion of individual freedom and autonomy

Some people may have legitimate reservations about the vaccine's safety or efficacy, and forcing them to get vaccinated against their will may damage faith in the healthcare system

Furthermore, enacting a required vaccination policy may provide practical issues, such as how to enforce it and handle vaccine exemptions

Finally, deciding whether to make Covid-19 immunization mandatory is a hard choice that needs weighing the possible advantages against the probable negatives

Rather than depending simply on a mandated vaccination program, governments and public health experts may find it advantageous to investigate a variety of measures, such as educational campaigns and incentives to encourage vaccination

I absolutely do not believe the covid-19 "vaccines" should be made mandatory

To the best of my knowledge the "vaccines" are still in the experimental stage and there is not enough data to prove that they are safe

I know for a fact that the "vaccine" does not prevent the disease or even hinder the spread of the virus

My biggest reason for being against the "vaccine" being mandatory is the harmful side effects caused by the "vaccine" up to and including death as per the CDC website

I dont think anything in our country should be mandatory, that's the whole point of the first couple amendments

Also, looking into the vaccination it isnt even a full immunity just something that makes covid weaker, which if people know Biology that only makes the virus stronger due to it being able to grow and adapt

Plus, the amount of people who have died after getting it with heart problems is entirely too many

I do not think the vaccines should be made mandatory

While the initial vaccines for the form of Covid-19 that was prevalent earlier in the pandemic were effective, I do not believe the boosters are effective against the later variants

I personally was vaccinated and became quite ill with Omicron nonetheless, as did many others I know

The vaccines are not safe for people with certain pre-existing conditions and have been linked to ill effects in some people

It is not reasonable, in my opinion, to force everyone to take the vaccine regardless of their personal health, circumstances, and beliefs

No, People should be able to make medical decisions for themselves

Yes, unless there are valid medical reasons not to

Almost universal vaccination will produce herd immunity, thus protecting those who cannot be vaccinated

No, I dont agree that Covid-19 vaccinations be made mandatory

It should be at the discrepancy of each individual's personal choices

A vaccination shouldn't be forced upon anyone as if they don't have freedom of will to decide what does or doesn't get injected into their system

I think it's very disrespectful to make decisions for someone other than one's self

Vaccinations should be offered, not mandatory, I 100% stand on this belief

I do not think that Covid-19 vaccination should be mandatory

It’s wrong to force any type of medical treatment on someone, and I think that people should have the choice

There is also the question of whether the vaccines are even as safe and effective as they were promised to be

News is coming out now about many adverse reactions and deaths related to the MRNA vaccines

I think it would be wrong to force a possibly harmful vaccine on the population

I believe that If the vaccines were made mandatory, it would be the beginning of a slippery slope to less freedom

Covid 19 is fake

Why vaccinate people who won't get the illness

We need to not support government overreach

Why is the government overstepping

Let's not mandate ths

The vaccine shout be mandatory because it will save lives

It seems to be proven that that vaccine is the reason why we were able to slow the spread and reduce the number of deaths

Without the vaccine we would probably still have random lockdowns, businesses closing because most of the staff is sick and even having trouble retaining of hiring staff because people do not want to be exposed to the virus

It should not be made mandatory

We should have the freedom to decide what to do with our own bodies

There also is not enough research of the long term effects of this vaccine

Definitely not something I would put into my body

The vaccine is about as effective (if not less) as a flu shot

It doesn’t prevent you from getting it

Only gives the possibility of lesser symptoms

Multiple boosters are suggested

No vaccine should be mandatory
