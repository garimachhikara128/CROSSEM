There also is not enough research of the long term effects of this vaccine. The vaccine is about as effective (if not less) as a flu shot. It doesn’t prevent you from getting it. Only gives the possibility of lesser symptoms. Multiple boosters are suggested. No vaccine should be mandatory. I do not think that Covid-19 vaccination should be mandatory. It’s wrong to force any type of medical treatment on someone, and I think that people should have the choice. There is also the question of whether the vaccines are even as safe and effective as they were promised to be. News is coming out now about many adverse reactions and deaths related to the MRNA vaccines. I think it would be wrong to force a possibly harmful vaccine on the population. I believe that If the vaccines were made mandatory, it would be the beginning of a slippery slope to less freedom. There have been instances in history where the public has been lied to that a vaccine was safe and it was later found out after it had caused major health damages. Waiting until someone has a medical damage to get a waiver already causes harm. And oftentimes doctors don't want to admit it could be the vaccine that caused it.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

Why vaccinate people who won't get the illness.   We need to not support government overreach.  Why is the government overstepping.  Let's not mandate ths.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)

It’s wrong to force any type of medical treatment on someone, and I think that people should have the choice. The vaccines are not safe for people with certain pre-existing conditions and have been linked to ill effects in some people. Generating fear and threatening the jobs of people just to force them to get a shot is not only unconstitutional, its criminal. It's not possible to know the long term effects of these drugs and it’s immoral to enforce a mandatory vaccine rule. There are many who lost their jobs simply for being unsure about the effectiveness or safety of this brand new vaccine. Forcing this decision onto people just makes it much harder to trust the government and health care systems. Our right to choose what goes into our body should remain intact. If the vaccine really is effective, time will prove that.",Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)
