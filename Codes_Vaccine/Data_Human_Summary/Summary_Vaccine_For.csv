The point is to reduce the severity of the disease, making it more likely that the recipient will live and not put a strain on the local healthcare system. I believe it should be mandatory with exceptions given for those who have legitimate, recorded medical reasons to refuse vaccinations. So, instead of their being a law somehow written that forces vaccinations, life should be made more difficult for those who actively refuse with no medical excuse. Public schooling should be inaccessible, health insurance should be more expensive, etc. So if someone values their 'freedom' more than they value these basic amenities, let them die on that hill, so to speak. From an economic stand point, it's probably more expensive to provide hospital care to a sick person than it is to provide a vaccine. I'm sure if there was a vaccine for cancer the public opinion would change. The same way you stop at a stop sign in order to prevent a dangerous situation for you or others - the vaccination is designed to protect yourself as well as the public around you. The vaccine shout be mandatory because it will save lives.",For (I feel positively about the vaccines)

If it's for the better toward the well-being of a bigger population, there should be no questions if it should be mandatory or not. Covid-19 vaccination should most definitely be mandatory. Like influenza, it will continue to mutate into new forms. As a result, it will continue to kill thousands to millions of people each year. Objectors contend that a vaccination won't prevent them from catching the coronavirus. While correct, that isn't the point of a vaccination. The point is to reduce the severity of the disease, making it more likely that the recipient will live and not put a strain on the local healthcare system.
Yes, unless there are valid medical reasons not to. Almost universal vaccination will produce herd immunity, thus protecting those who cannot be vaccinated.",For (I feel positively about the vaccines)

Like influenza, it will continue to mutate into new forms. As a result, it will continue to kill thousands to millions of people each year. The point is to reduce the severity of the disease, making it more likely that the recipient will live and not put a strain on the local healthcare system. New variants seem to appear daily. People who have been vaccinated have caught Covid due only to the selfish people who do not think they need to get vaccinated. Its absolutely not fair to those people who have done their duty as a human being to end up in the hospital due to the fact that a lot of people think they are better than everyone else in this country and remain unvaccinated. Without the vaccine we would probably still have random lockdowns, businesses closing because most of the staff is sick and even having trouble retaining of hiring staff because people do not want to be exposed to the virus. Almost universal vaccination will produce herd immunity, thus protecting those who cannot be vaccinated. Although we do not know the potential future drawbacks, this can be said for a variety of things, including many foods we eat and many products we use.",For (I feel positively about the vaccines)
