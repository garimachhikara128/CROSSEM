It should not be made mandatory

We should have the freedom to decide what to do with our own bodies

There also is not enough research of the long term effects of this vaccine

The vaccine is about as effective (if not less) as a flu shot

It doesn’t prevent you from getting it

Only gives the possibility of lesser symptoms

Multiple boosters are suggested

No vaccine should be mandatory

I do not think that Covid-19 vaccination should be mandatory

It’s wrong to force any type of medical treatment on someone, and I think that people should have the choice

There is also the question of whether the vaccines are even as safe and effective as they were promised to be

News is coming out now about many adverse reactions and deaths related to the MRNA vaccines

I think it would be wrong to force a possibly harmful vaccine on the population

I believe that If the vaccines were made mandatory, it would be the beginning of a slippery slope to less freedom

There have been instances in history where the public has been lied to that a vaccine was safe and it was later found out after it had caused major health damages

Waiting until someone has a medical damage to get a waiver already causes harm

And oftentimes doctors don't want to admit it could be the vaccine that caused it
