Covid-19 vaccination should most definitely be mandatory

Yes, it is in the interest of the public to keep people safe

The point is to reduce the severity of the disease, making it more likely that the recipient will live and not put a strain on the local healthcare system

I believe it should be mandatory with exceptions given for those who have legitimate, recorded medical reasons to refuse vaccinations

So, instead of their being a law somehow written that forces vaccinations, life should be made more difficult for those who actively refuse with no medical excuse

Public schooling should be inaccessible, health insurance should be more expensive, etc

So if someone values their 'freedom' more than they value these basic amenities, let them die on that hill, so to speak

From an economic stand point, it's probably more expensive to provide hospital care to a sick person than it is to provide a vaccine

I'm sure if there was a vaccine for cancer the public opinion would change

The same way you stop at a stop sign in order to prevent a dangerous situation for you or others - the vaccination is designed to protect yourself as well as the public around you

The vaccine shout be mandatory because it will save lives
