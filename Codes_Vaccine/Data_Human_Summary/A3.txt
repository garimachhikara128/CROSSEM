The vaccine should not be mandatory under any circumstance

It still has not been sufficiently proven to be safe

It’s wrong to force any type of medical treatment on someone, and I think that people should have the choice

The vaccines are not safe for people with certain pre-existing conditions and have been linked to ill effects in some people

Generating fear and threatening the jobs of people just to force them to get a shot is not only unconstitutional, its criminal

It's not possible to know the long term effects of these drugs and it’s immoral to enforce a mandatory vaccine rule

There are many who lost their jobs simply for being unsure about the effectiveness or safety of this brand new vaccine

Forcing this decision onto people just makes it much harder to trust the government and health care systems

Our right to choose what goes into our body should remain intact

If the vaccine really is effective, time will prove that
