Covid-19 vaccines should not be made mandatory in any way

covid -19 vaccination should be voluntary, my body my choice

It’s wrong to force any type of medical treatment on someone, and I think that people should have the choice

I don't believe the government should be able to force me to inject anything into my body for any reasonI absolutely do not believe the covid-19 "vaccines" should be made mandatory

The vaccine is about as effective (if not less) as a flu shot

It doesn’t prevent you from getting it

Only gives the possibility of lesser symptoms

Multiple boosters are suggested

No vaccine should be mandatory

Why vaccinate people who won't get the illness

We need to not support government overreach

Why is the government overstepping

Let's not mandate ths
