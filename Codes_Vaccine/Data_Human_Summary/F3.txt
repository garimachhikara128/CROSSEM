Anti vaccera are just selfish individuals

We need to help each other rise above this current crisis

Like influenza, it will continue to mutate into new forms

As a result, it will continue to kill thousands to millions of people each year

The point is to reduce the severity of the disease, making it more likely that the recipient will live and not put a strain on the local healthcare system

New variants seem to appear daily

People who have been vaccinated have caught Covid due only to the selfish people who do not think they need to get vaccinated

Its absolutely not fair to those people who have done their duty as a human being to end up in the hospital due to the fact that a lot of people think they are better than everyone else in this country and remain unvaccinated

Without the vaccine we would probably still have random lockdowns, businesses closing because most of the staff is sick and even having trouble retaining of hiring staff because people do not want to be exposed to the virus

Almost universal vaccination will produce herd immunity, thus protecting those who cannot be vaccinated

Although we do not know the potential future drawbacks, this can be said for a variety of things, including many foods we eat and many products we use
