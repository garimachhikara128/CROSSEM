01/08/23 9:01,I agree,63ba24953b6208ca183b82af,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"Yes, It is in the interest of the public to keep people safe. Anti vaccera are just selfish individuals. We need to help each other rise above this current crisis."
01/08/23 9:05,I agree,614fa15c0f4a7cbe8a3b1df8,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"Covid-19 vaccination should most definitely be mandatory. Like influenza, it will continue to mutate into new forms. As a result, it will continue to kill thousands to millions of people each year. Objectors contend that a vaccination won't prevent them from catching the coronavirus. While correct, that isn't the point of a vaccination. The point is to reduce the severity of the disease, making it more likely that the recipient will live and not put a strain on the local healthcare system."
01/08/23 9:07,I agree,5dcf85c64a113a0ba2cc2cce,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"Covid-19 vaccines should not be made mandatory in any way. First of all, these are our bodies, we choose what goes in them. The ingredients in any vaccine are deemed unsafe. There is a vaccine court where the injured or deceased get paid. Vaccines kill, but I am all about choice."
01/08/23 9:09,I agree,5e8bfad5b546910e7553a080,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"It's hard to say, some people do react poorly to it myself included. It's seemingly becoming similar to the flu where it's something that is seemingly only necessary for those at risk such as the elderly or those with auto-immune deficiencies. I personally don't get flu shots nor do I get it more than once every several years. I'm unsure it's at the point where mandatory vaccination would eradicate COVID-19, and the logistics of trying to accomplish something like that seems difficult to put it lightly. While I support getting the vaccination, which I have, I have my doubts this will go away and will be something we live with moving forward. I think instead of mandatory vaccination, trying to educate the public on the benefits for those who really need it, and providing further education on keeping ourselves healthy and less susceptible to the illness would be good as well; this should begin at the primary school level."
01/08/23 9:18,I agree,63b6e90cf33c821065cbfa7d,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"I believe it should be mandatory with exceptions given for those who have legitimate, recorded medical reasons to refuse vaccinations. Individuals have an obligation to their society, and refusal of vaccinations for flimsy political and religious excuses are harmful to society at large and deeply selfish. That being said, I do have some apprehensions towards making any medical decision mandatory. So, instead of their being a law somehow written that forces vaccinations, life should be made more difficult for those who actively refuse with no medical excuse. Public schooling should be inaccessible, health insurance should be more expensive, etc. So if someone values their 'freedom' more than they value these basic amenities, let them die on that hill, so to speak. People who would sacrifice human lives for their own comfort do not deserve to reap the rewards of those who make sacrifices for others."
01/08/23 9:21,I agree,6336ee64afe76b41281661cb,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"Covid-19 vaccinations should NOT be made mandatory, First of all we don't know the long term effects of the vaccine. The vaccination does not even seem effective. I know many people who received the COVID-19 vaccination and they still ended up getting the Covid-19 virus. I also feel like the government CDC, FDA, WHO just cant go and force you to get the Covid-19 vaccinations. People would NOT stand for it and they know that, There is also side effects from the Covid-19 vaccination so in reality if it was forced on the public it could do more harm then good. "
01/08/23 9:22,I agree,5bd914e9a0e4d80001a405a0,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"It's at the point where Covid vaccination needs to become mandatory. New variants seem to appear daily. People who have been vaccinated have caught Covid due only to the selfish people who do not think they need to get vaccinated. Its absolutely not fair to those people who have done their duty as a human being to end up in the hospital due to the fact that a lot of people think they are better than everyone else in this country and remain unvaccinated. Its almost unbelievable that other diseases like Measles are starting to outbreak because of this same mentality. It's irresponsible, and downright evil to live in a world and not want to protect other human beings. "
01/08/23 9:23,I agree,5f4941b3030fef46cc14ec2b,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"I don't believe the government should be able to force me to inject anything into my body for any reason.  I think it's a great overreach of power to do so.  I don't think the vaccines have been studied long enough or thoroughly enough to convince me they're harmless.  It's not possible to know the long term effects of these drugs and its immoral to enforce a mandatory vaccine rule. Nobody should have that much power in a free country,  ever. "
01/08/23 9:30,I agree,630cd2673e85b493c38fe663,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"Overall, I am leaning towards the COVID vaccination being mandatory for a couple of reasons. One, many children are required to be vaccinated when they enter school for a variety of other illnesses. If that is the case, then a COVID vaccine should also be considered mandatory. Another reason is that COVID has made such a significant impact on society over the past few years. In addition, people continue to die from COVID every day, and there remains thousands of people in the hospital who have COVID. Mandating a COVID vaccination would almost eliminate the endemic nature of COVID. However I am concerned about the political and moral ramifications of mandating the vaccination because mandating is a strong solution. "
01/08/23 9:30,I agree,6287cced8b5c58604fe147d4,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"yes, it should. If it's for the better toward the well-being of a bigger population, there should be no questions if it should be mandatory or not."
01/10/23 0:34,I agree,5c6a617c4330ba000182510e,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),No it should not be. People should be able to make their own choices. Autonomy is a huge part of being an American citizen. The vaccines are new and not enough long term studies have been done. People should be allowed to deny the vaccine if they donâ€™t feel it is safe or studied enough yet. It should not be forced on people.
01/10/23 0:37,I agree,61042b4421f724dc8f6d80eb,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"covid -19 vaccination should be voluntary, my body my choice."
01/08/23 9:32,I agree,5ea9a6d22998a70e1f5e59b7,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"I believe it should be mandatory. Things in life are made to help people. The government isn't trying to oppress you. They want it's citizens to be healthy. From an economic stand point, it's probably more expensive to provide hospital care to a sick person than it is to provide a vaccine. I'm sure if there was a vaccine for cancer the public opinion would change. I could see people rushing to get vaccinated for that.  "
01/08/23 9:33,I agree,605d0687aa6cd6cdf1a634ee,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"Yes, I feel that it's proven to be effective and safe. There are clear signs of how the vaccine has positive benefits presently/future. It's irresponsible to not be vaccinated. It's free and easy to do.  It helps protects those who are most vulnerable and it's just another shot like any other. There is no difference than getting shots when you're a kid so its really not a big deal. "
01/08/23 9:34,I agree,62e027478bb6dca099c2e207,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),I think Covid vaccines should be mandatory because it is a matter of public health.  The same way you stop at a stop sign in order to prevent a dangerous situation for you or others - the vaccination is designed to protect yourself as well as the public around you.  You need to think about more than yourself when making decisions.
01/08/23 9:34,I agree,55b6ed4afdf99b437183fa6f,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"Not only should covid vaccines not be made mandatory, they should be stopped immediately. They have been shown to be the cause of many illnesses and deaths. There has been so much deception surrounding this shot. Generating fear and threatening the jobs of people just to force them to get a shot is not only unconstitutional, its criminal. Because it put people's lives in danger. Whoever forced this medical experiment on others against their will without full disclosure and consent should be punished and held accountable, so it doesn't happen again. "
01/08/23 9:34,I agree,608cc945d87a9e15dcf958a5,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"Covid-19 is pretty deadly.  People forget just how much of the world's population died of it, especially in the initial stages in China and in large population clusters and cities in the world.  It was wreaking Havoc.  Losing 1-3% of your population doesn't sound like a lot, but that depopulates the workforce so quickly that it interrupts the supply chain and creates all sorts of logical issues.  Even now in 2023 when the world, or at least the USA, thinks it is mostly 'under control', we have another outbreak in China and a massive struggle for the government to contain it.  The vaccines have been proven effective to reduce the fatalities.  People can still get sick, but so long as they survive, that's the key function of the vaccines.  Turn it from a killer back to the flu like symptoms."
01/08/23 9:35,I agree,6275b16d8e297e41f4521ca3,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"I think the Covid-19 vaccine should be made mandatory with only a few medical and approved exceptions. Vaccination requirements are nothing new and have been in place for decades. They are necessary to attend public schools, work for certain companies, join the military, etc. This new Covid-19 vaccine should be no different, given how it was rigorously tested by medical professionals and passed all FDA requirements. Although we do not know the potential future drawbacks, this can be said for a variety of things, including many foods we eat and many products we use. Furthermore, we have already seen its efficacy and most medical professionals believe its positives (saving millions of lives) outweigh its potential negatives."
01/08/23 9:40,I agree,6069e759f1e6dd24c669ebb4,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"On the one hand, vaccinations are a successful method of preventing the spread of infectious illnesses, and Covid-19 immunization in particular has the potential to aid in pandemic control and protect vulnerable people. Making vaccination mandatory might assist guarantee that enough individuals are vaccinated to develop herd immunity, protecting others who are unable to obtain the vaccine due to medical reasons. Mandating vaccination, on the other hand, violates the notion of individual freedom and autonomy. Some people may have legitimate reservations about the vaccine's safety or efficacy, and forcing them to get vaccinated against their will may damage faith in the healthcare system. Furthermore, enacting a required vaccination policy may provide practical issues, such as how to enforce it and handle vaccine exemptions.  Finally, deciding whether to make Covid-19 immunization mandatory is a hard choice that needs weighing the possible advantages against the probable negatives. Rather than depending simply on a mandated vaccination program, governments and public health experts may find it advantageous to investigate a variety of measures, such as educational campaigns and incentives to encourage vaccination."
01/08/23 9:42,I agree,60d94719ae18aa216a520fc9,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"I absolutely do not believe the covid-19 ""vaccines"" should be made mandatory. To the best of my knowledge the ""vaccines"" are still in the experimental stage and there is not enough data to prove that they are safe. I know for a fact that the ""vaccine"" does not prevent the disease or even hinder the spread of the virus. My biggest reason for being against the ""vaccine"" being mandatory is the harmful side effects caused by the ""vaccine"" up to and including death as per the CDC website."
01/08/23 9:43,I agree,5dc5237c2b1e543b3a713d18,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"I dont think anything in our country should be mandatory, that's the whole point of the first couple amendments. Also, looking into the vaccination it isnt even a full immunity just something that makes covid weaker, which if people know Biology that only makes the virus stronger due to it being able to grow and adapt. Plus, the amount of people who have died after getting it with heart problems is entirely too many. "
01/08/23 9:43,I agree,5e8ba701c2bb4d085e04cd58,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"I do not think the vaccines should be made mandatory. While the initial vaccines for the form of Covid-19 that was prevalent earlier in the pandemic were effective, I do not believe the boosters are effective against the later variants. I personally was vaccinated and became quite ill with Omicron nonetheless, as did many others I know. The vaccines are not safe for people with certain pre-existing conditions and have been linked to ill effects in some people. It is not reasonable, in my opinion, to force everyone to take the vaccine regardless of their personal health, circumstances, and beliefs."
01/08/23 9:46,I agree,62db3b6d1176a3312cfaafe4,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"No, People should be able to make medical decisions for themselves. "
01/08/23 9:46,I agree,5c26b151c4b6e3000152c0b8,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"Yes, unless there are valid medical reasons not to. Almost universal vaccination will produce herd immunity, thus protecting those who cannot be vaccinated."
01/09/23 23:53,I agree,5d57062817ee8d0001cda0f6,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"No, I dont agree that Covid-19 vaccinations be made mandatory. It should be at the discrepancy of each individual's personal choices. A vaccination shouldn't be forced upon anyone as if they don't have freedom of will to decide what does or doesn't get injected into their system. I think it's very disrespectful to make decisions for someone other than one's self. Vaccinations should be offered, not mandatory, I 100% stand on this belief."
01/10/23 0:11,I agree,5c28a7d31c8e4c0001b2e0a4,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),"I do not think that Covid-19 vaccination should be mandatory. Itâ€™s wrong to force any type of medical treatment on someone, and I think that people should have the choice. There is also the question of whether the vaccines are even as safe and effective as they were promised to be. News is coming out now about many adverse reactions and deaths related to the MRNA vaccines. I think it would be wrong to force a possibly harmful vaccine on the population. I believe that If the vaccines were made mandatory, it would be the beginning of a slippery slope to less freedom. "
01/10/23 0:12,I agree,6297567582d2ed2d88ae0450,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),Covid 19 is fake.  Why vaccinate people who won't get the illness.   We need to not support government overreach.  Why is the government overstepping.  Let's not mandate ths.
01/10/23 0:12,I agree,6167676658c84c346e005682,For (I feel positively about the vaccines),"The vaccine shout be mandatory because it will save lives. It seems to be proven that that vaccine is the reason why we were able to slow the spread and reduce the number of deaths. Without the vaccine we would probably still have random lockdowns, businesses closing because most of the staff is sick and even having trouble retaining of hiring staff because people do not want to be exposed to the virus."
01/10/23 0:17,I agree,60fe095a27a19c4dc0eb5e0e,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),It should not be made mandatory. We should have the freedom to decide what to do with our own bodies. There also is not enough research of the long term effects of this vaccine. Definitely not something I would put into my body. 
01/10/23 0:25,I agree,5cb742eafab1d30015b8e198,Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines),The vaccine is about as effective (if not less) as a flu shot. It doesnâ€™t prevent you from getting it. Only gives the possibility of lesser symptoms. Multiple boosters are suggested. No vaccine should be mandatory.
