Learn what is in the vaccine, How it was rushed, The way the government gave immunity to the pharma companies making the vaccine. Have them read The Real Anthony Fauci  Book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. instead of getting all hyped up by cnn, msnbc etc. . Why was Bill Gates so involved with the vaccine? He is not a scientist, just someone from a rich family who stole anaother persons operating system and made billions. If people would research instead of just believing what they see on television I believe people would stand up and rise up. Reality is the covid-19 virus came from China and funding was coming from organizations Fauci was involved with because gain of function research is too dangerous and was not allowed to be done in the united states so they secretly funded the lab in Wuhan and here we are today","Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines)"
