The current economic situation is mostly to do with Brexit and the UK leaving the EU

This is due to us having reduced trade and there being more tariffs and barriers

Also, the cost of goods has increased and we simply are having to pay more for goods from European countries due to tariffs that are in place

It is not all due to Brexit however, the current Conservative government has handled the economy very poorly ensuring those a the top are cared for whilst those at the middle and bottom are left to fend for themselves

However, I do believe that if we rejoined the EU that would solve a lot of our problems, including but not limited to a better economy, better workers rights and more cooperation

The UK economy is moribund as a direct consequence of Brexit

While the heaviest impact won't be felt for some time, I feel that we have now begun an irreversible decline

This along with the with the associated optics of those who championed Brexit has left the UK as not very business friendly place to invest or to visit

I don't think the conditions can be blamed solely on Brexit as there's also effects from the Ukranian war and COVID, but Brexit weakened our economy at a critical time which has severely diminished our ability to trade internationally and to borrow from other nations

It will play some part in affecting trade agreements and affect some labour laws for the worse
