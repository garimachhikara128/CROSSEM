While the heaviest impact won't be felt for some time, I feel that we have now begun an irreversible decline

I don't think the conditions can be blamed solely on Brexit as there's also effects from the Ukranian war and COVID, but Brexit weakened our economy at a critical time which has severely diminished our ability to trade internationally and to borrow from other nations

I don't believe that the current economic woes are caused *solely* by BREXIT, but it did play a large part

Certainly our being apart from Europe has impacted us financially and in other, less tangible yet more far-reaching ways

My feeling is that there would have been more progress in solving these issues if the other previously mentioned problems had not arisen

"Build Back Better" will benefit ONLY the multi billionaires who are running this evil show and they havent finished with us yet!

Better preparation would have helped as it was obvious to me there may be a close vote

The young seem to feel part of Europe and they still can be but on different terms

Brexit is a gigantic act of self-harm inflicted by uncomprehending voters who hoped for easy solutions to complicated problems, including things that were never really problems related to the European Union but were mis-described by the media and politicians for decades

leaving was allways going to cause problems, however this has been massively made worse by other factors such as covid and the war in ukraine
