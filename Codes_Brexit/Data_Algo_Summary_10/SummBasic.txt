Brexit has been a disaster

It has made it more expensive to import goods from Europe as well as making it harder to export to Europe

We were stronger together

Not very good, strikes are causing problems, cost off food rises in supermarkets

Is making it hard for families to be able to feed themselves and there children

The NHS is struggling, because of a shortage of staff, most of the doctors where from different countries, which has made it hard for them to retain visas

I think it's a culmination of brexit and corona

Brexit was always going to cause issues but it will be worth it in the long run

My opinion is that the  current economic condition of the UK is not caused by Brexit

While Brexit, and the issues caused by it, have not helped, they are not the over riding cause
