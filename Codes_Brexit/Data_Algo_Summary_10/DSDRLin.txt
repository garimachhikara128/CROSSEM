Although some of it may have been caused by Brexit I donâ€™t think it can be said the current economic condition is solely because of Brexit

There is less of everything, also everything is now much, Much more expensive, and now I hear that most people want us to return back to the EU, I honestly believe that this has been the worst decision by the government that I have ever seen since I have been alive, the thing that really get to me is this was so obvious how could they not see that this was going to happen, this was definitely thinking the grass is greener on the other side except there was no other side, just us, all alone, they really thought the pound wold get stronger? and that everyone would buy from us? Ridiculous!

Membership of the EU meant that if you imported goods from outside the EU that you could have got within it you had to pay a fine, so Brexit is a long-term bet that in 20 years trade with the Far East will be more important than trade with Europe

Brexit is a gigantic act of self-harm inflicted by uncomprehending voters who hoped for easy solutions to complicated problems, including things that were never really problems related to the European Union but were mis-described by the media and politicians for decades

Many of our problems, however, are caused primarily by our self-defeating insistence on opening up state assets to the free market - except not even the free market as we would understand it, but a world of dodgy backhanders where failing privatised businesses are propped up by the taxpayer

Our system has many perverse incentives for bad faith actors to cause economic harm to the country in exchange for short-term personal rewards - an example was the whole debacle around the Liz Truss economic plan

I don't think the conditions can be blamed solely on Brexit as there's also effects from the Ukranian war and COVID, but Brexit weakened our economy at a critical time which has severely diminished our ability to trade internationally and to borrow from other nations

This stands to reason because the UK doesn't enjoy the discounted rates for trading that were available while it was part of the EU, and this also increased taxes in the UK

The hope is that both sides can get back to dealing with Brexit issues once the Russia-Ukraine situation and the subsequent energy supply and cost issues have eventually subsided

However, I do believe that if we rejoined the EU that would solve a lot of our problems, including but not limited to a better economy, better workers rights and more cooperation
