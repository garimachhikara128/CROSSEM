The current economic situation is mostly to do with Brexit and the UK leaving the EU

Although some of it may have been caused by Brexit I donâ€™t think it can be said the current economic condition is solely because of Brexit

This along with the with the associated optics of those who championed Brexit has left the UK as not very business friendly place to invest or to visit

I don't think the conditions can be blamed solely on Brexit as there's also effects from the Ukranian war and COVID, but Brexit weakened our economy at a critical time which has severely diminished our ability to trade internationally and to borrow from other nations

My feeling is that there would have been more progress in solving these issues if the other previously mentioned problems had not arisen

Economic and political conditions have changed since 2021,  making the Brexiters dream of a global Britain trading with US, China and India a pipe dream (which it always was anyway)

My opinion is that the economy has worsened due to Brexit

There were always going to be difficulties inputting new regimes

Brexit is hugely to blame for our terrible economy

Other things have also affected the economy such as the unfortunate war in Ukraine and covid
