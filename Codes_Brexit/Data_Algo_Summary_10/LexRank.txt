The current economic situation is mostly to do with Brexit and the UK leaving the EU

It's not caused by brexit it's caused by the war

Although some of it may have been caused by Brexit I donâ€™t think it can be said the current economic condition is solely because of Brexit

All of which have nothing to do with Brexit

My opinion is that the  current economic condition of the UK is not caused by Brexit

It has made it more expensive to import goods from Europe as well as making it harder to export to Europe

This has all been worsened by a government who are by far the worse government for a couple of decades

I think Brexit definitely had and has a part in it

There is less of everything, also everything is now much, Much more expensive, and now I hear that most people want us to return back to the EU, I honestly believe that this has been the worst decision by the government that I have ever seen since I have been alive, the thing that really get to me is this was so obvious how could they not see that this was going to happen, this was definitely thinking the grass is greener on the other side except there was no other side, just us, all alone, they really thought the pound wold get stronger?

The current UK economic condition is certainly influenced by Brexit
