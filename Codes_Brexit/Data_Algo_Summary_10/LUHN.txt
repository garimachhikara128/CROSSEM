Also, the cost of goods has increased and we simply are having to pay more for goods from European countries due to tariffs that are in place

It is not all due to Brexit however, the current Conservative government has handled the economy very poorly ensuring those a the top are cared for whilst those at the middle and bottom are left to fend for themselves

However, I do believe that if we rejoined the EU that would solve a lot of our problems, including but not limited to a better economy, better workers rights and more cooperation

Although some of it may have been caused by Brexit I donâ€™t think it can be said the current economic condition is solely because of Brexit

I don't think the conditions can be blamed solely on Brexit as there's also effects from the Ukranian war and COVID, but Brexit weakened our economy at a critical time which has severely diminished our ability to trade internationally and to borrow from other nations

Membership of the EU meant that if you imported goods from outside the EU that you could have got within it you had to pay a fine, so Brexit is a long-term bet that in 20 years trade with the Far East will be more important than trade with Europe

I don't think that the current economic condition of the United Kingdom has anything to do with Brexit, although that is just guesswork on my part as I don't really know

Potentially part of the poor current economic condition of the UK could have been caused from Brexit - namely due to the restriction of free movement leading to reduction in workers and people purchasing

There is less of everything, also everything is now much, Much more expensive, and now I hear that most people want us to return back to the EU, I honestly believe that this has been the worst decision by the government that I have ever seen since I have been alive, the thing that really get to me is this was so obvious how could they not see that this was going to happen, this was definitely thinking the grass is greener on the other side except there was no other side, just us, all alone, they really thought the pound wold get stronger?

Many of our problems, however, are caused primarily by our self-defeating insistence on opening up state assets to the free market - except not even the free market as we would understand it, but a world of dodgy backhanders where failing privatised businesses are propped up by the taxpayer
