The current economic situation is mostly to do with Brexit and the UK leaving the EU

There have been many factors that have contributed to the economic condition

I do not think the current condition is directly caused by brexit however itâ€™s caused by lots of factors

There are, of course, issues to still be resolved that are causing problems as a result of Brexit

I don't think that the current economic condition of the United Kingdom has anything to do with Brexit, although that is just guesswork on my part as I don't really know

It has made it more expensive to import goods from Europe as well as making it harder to export to Europe

It seems that the world is growing more insular and it may have been better to join the trend at the start

The young seem to feel part of Europe and they still can be but on different terms

I think Brexit definitely had and has a part in it

Brexit is a gigantic act of self-harm inflicted by uncomprehending voters who hoped for easy solutions to complicated problems, including things that were never really problems related to the European Union but were mis-described by the media and politicians for decades
