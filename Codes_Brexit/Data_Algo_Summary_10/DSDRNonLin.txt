Many of our problems, however, are caused primarily by our self-defeating insistence on opening up state assets to the free market - except not even the free market as we would understand it, but a world of dodgy backhanders where failing privatised businesses are propped up by the taxpayer

There is less of everything, also everything is now much, Much more expensive, and now I hear that most people want us to return back to the EU, I honestly believe that this has been the worst decision by the government that I have ever seen since I have been alive, the thing that really get to me is this was so obvious how could they not see that this was going to happen, this was definitely thinking the grass is greener on the other side except there was no other side, just us, all alone, they really thought the pound wold get stronger? and that everyone would buy from us? Ridiculous!

We are spending huge sums of money to keep immigration down because we have shut down all legal routes to claim asylam because our borders have become more strict

Our system has many perverse incentives for bad faith actors to cause economic harm to the country in exchange for short-term personal rewards - an example was the whole debacle around the Liz Truss economic plan

The cost of housing in any format is completely unreflective of wages, and we seem to have a government who has no clue about how the majority live, or simply doesn't care

Brexit is a gigantic act of self-harm inflicted by uncomprehending voters who hoped for easy solutions to complicated problems, including things that were never really problems related to the European Union but were mis-described by the media and politicians for decades

Also everything takes longer to travel around Europe, which impedes flexibility and ensure we all lose trade to swifter economies, like China

Economic and political conditions have changed since 2021,  making the Brexiters dream of a global Britain trading with US, China and India a pipe dream (which it always was anyway)

Also, the cost of goods has increased and we simply are having to pay more for goods from European countries due to tariffs that are in place

It has caused us to lose a lot of European workers meaning farmers have been unable to harvest crops making the products mor expensive to buy
