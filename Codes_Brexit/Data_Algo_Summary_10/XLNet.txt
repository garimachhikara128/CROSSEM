The current economic situation is mostly to do with Brexit and the UK leaving the EU

I dont believe that the country has made the best of Brexit yet

Although some of it may have been caused by Brexit I donâ€™t think it can be said the current economic condition is solely because of Brexit

I don't think the conditions can be blamed solely on Brexit as there's also effects from the Ukranian war and COVID, but Brexit weakened our economy at a critical time which has severely diminished our ability to trade internationally and to borrow from other nations

The hope is that both sides can get back to dealing with Brexit issues once the Russia-Ukraine situation and the subsequent energy supply and cost issues have eventually subsided

Better preparation would have helped as it was obvious to me there may be a close vote

Even had we remained in The Union there would have been complications as member states had differing ideas about the war

Many industries in the UK are struggling to recruit staff as freddom of movement has stopped

Potentially part of the poor current economic condition of the UK could have been caused from Brexit - namely due to the restriction of free movement leading to reduction in workers and people purchasing

Brexit has made trade more difficult and has weakened our position as a global and regional power
