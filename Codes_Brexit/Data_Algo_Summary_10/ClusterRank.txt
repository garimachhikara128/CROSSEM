There is less of everything, also everything is now much, Much more expensive, and now I hear that most people want us to return back to the EU, I honestly believe that this has been the worst decision by the government that I have ever seen since I have been alive, the thing that really get to me is this was so obvious how could they not see that this was going to happen, this was definitely thinking the grass is greener on the other side except there was no other side, just us, all alone, they really thought the pound wold get stronger? and that everyone would buy from us? Ridiculous!

Many of our problems, however, are caused primarily by our self-defeating insistence on opening up state assets to the free market - except not even the free market as we would understand it, but a world of dodgy backhanders where failing privatised businesses are propped up by the taxpayer

Brexit is a gigantic act of self-harm inflicted by uncomprehending voters who hoped for easy solutions to complicated problems, including things that were never really problems related to the European Union but were mis-described by the media and politicians for decades

I don't think the conditions can be blamed solely on Brexit as there's also effects from the Ukranian war and COVID, but Brexit weakened our economy at a critical time which has severely diminished our ability to trade internationally and to borrow from other nations

Membership of the EU meant that if you imported goods from outside the EU that you could have got within it you had to pay a fine, so Brexit is a long-term bet that in 20 years trade with the Far East will be more important than trade with Europe

It is not all due to Brexit however, the current Conservative government has handled the economy very poorly ensuring those a the top are cared for whilst those at the middle and bottom are left to fend for themselves

Our system has many perverse incentives for bad faith actors to cause economic harm to the country in exchange for short-term personal rewards - an example was the whole debacle around the Liz Truss economic plan

Potentially part of the poor current economic condition of the UK could have been caused from Brexit - namely due to the restriction of free movement leading to reduction in workers and people purchasing

yes, a failure to to replace all regional investment and funding from the previous EU as well the increased adminstration to trade with the continent has lead to a decrease in the economic growth

Economic and political conditions have changed since 2021,  making the Brexiters dream of a global Britain trading with US, China and India a pipe dream (which it always was anyway)
