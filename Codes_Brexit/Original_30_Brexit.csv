01/08/23 9:09,I agree,62b07159ba623a4beb4012e0,Remain,"The current economic situation is mostly to do with Brexit and the UK leaving the EU. This is due to us having reduced trade and there being more tariffs and barriers. Also, the cost of goods has increased and we simply are having to pay more for goods from European countries due to tariffs that are in place. It is not all due to Brexit however, the current Conservative government has handled the economy very poorly ensuring those a the top are cared for whilst those at the middle and bottom are left to fend for themselves. However, I do believe that if we rejoined the EU that would solve a lot of our problems, including but not limited to a better economy, better workers rights and more cooperation."
01/08/23 9:10,I agree,5fb4b543282b20203734ba72,Remain,"The UK economy is moribund as a direct consequence of Brexit. While the heaviest impact won't be felt for some time, I feel that we have now begun an irreversible decline. We've lost our biggest trading partner because of the ideological blindness of a party of populists. "
01/09/23 23:13,I agree,61112224a467c6ac0028d1e2,Leave,"I dont believe that the country has made the best of Brexit yet. It took 3 years to get through following the vote. Opposition parties damaged our country in that time by trying to stop the will of the people. We should get the Irish situation shorted out asap. We should ""take control"" of our borders and send migrants back to where they came. We can make Brexit a success we just need the Government to grow some balls and get on with it."
01/09/23 23:14,I agree,58ab5e778bf22a00015b907d,Leave,It's not caused by brexit it's caused by the war.
01/09/23 23:18,I agree,615233b197ee051f7fbabd6f,Leave,"Although some of it may have been caused by Brexit I don’t think it can be said the current economic condition is solely because of Brexit. There have been many factors that have contributed to the economic condition. Global pandemic, poor government decision making has played a part. The Russian/Ukraine war saw gas prices increase. All of which have nothing to do with Brexit."
01/08/23 9:14,I agree,5eac351c63858608351866b4,Remain,"yes, a failure to to replace all regional investment and funding from the previous EU as well the increased adminstration to trade with the continent has lead to a decrease in the economic growth. This along with the with the associated optics of those who championed Brexit has left the UK as not very business friendly place to invest or to visit."
01/08/23 9:15,I agree,63484e978512958f261935e2,Remain,"I don't think the conditions can be blamed solely on Brexit as there's also effects from the Ukranian war and COVID, but Brexit weakened our economy at a critical time which has severely diminished our ability to trade internationally and to borrow from other nations."
01/09/23 23:24,I agree,5fec4bf28fd71dda83c7f34e,Leave,"I don't believe it's to blame, at least to the extent that is being suggested here. It will play some part in affecting trade agreements and affect some labour laws for the worse. However, the main cause of the economic situation at present is the Conservative Party, who have been in power for twelve years. It is their mismanagement and incompetence along with corruption that have spiraled out of control. All this could have been prevented if the British public had voted in Jeremy Corbin. "
01/08/23 9:18,I agree,60be448c7a00c44fbb47500e,Remain,"I do not think the current condition is directly caused by brexit however it’s caused by lots of factors. 
Brexit has meant many things in our economy has changed and it’s made life a lot harder for many. 
We didn’t need to leave and this has cost us a lot of money. 
Covid had a huge unpack on our economy and so have the changing of our priminister."
01/08/23 9:28,I agree,628fa6032c88793a56546851,Remain,"I don't believe that the current economic woes are caused *solely* by BREXIT, but it did play a large part. Certainly our being apart from Europe has impacted us financially and in other, less tangible yet more far-reaching ways. Closer ties to Europe would be helpful as we attempt to navigate into energy independence and towards a greener planet. For sure, trading with Europe has become more expensive. Also everything takes longer to travel around Europe, which impedes flexibility and ensure we all lose trade to swifter economies, like China. We were stronger together."
01/08/23 9:29,I agree,6112892b5e6ad30da6d84b9e,Leave,"Not very good, strikes are causing problems, cost off food rises in supermarkets. Is making it hard for families to be able to feed themselves and there children. The NHS is struggling, because of a shortage of staff, most of the doctors where from different countries, which has made it hard for them to retain visas. "
01/08/23 9:29,I agree,6107247967dedd82e06c6f27,Leave,I think it's a culmination of brexit and corona. Brexit was always going to cause issues but it will be worth it in the long run.
01/08/23 9:29,I agree,60f4696161736ffaef73b434,Leave,"My opinion is that the  current economic condition of the UK is not caused by Brexit. While Brexit, and the issues caused by it, have not helped, they are not the over riding cause. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the energy crisis resulting from this are much more to blame. There are, of course, issues to still be resolved that are causing problems as a result of Brexit. My feeling is that there would have been more progress in solving these issues if the other previously mentioned problems had not arisen. The UK and Europe are too busy with these other issues to spend much time and effort dealing with Brexit related ones at present. The hope is that both sides can get back to dealing with Brexit issues once the Russia-Ukraine situation and the subsequent energy supply and cost issues have eventually subsided."
01/08/23 9:30,I agree,6150792b260ce6cdd47941c9,Remain,"It is certainly not helping,  Businesses are finding it more difficult to import goods which is adding to costs.  More concerningly, they are finding exporting more complex and costly, with many deciding not to export as much. This is lowering income and impacting GDP growth. Economic and political conditions have changed since 2021,  making the Brexiters dream of a global Britain trading with US, China and India a pipe dream (which it always was anyway).  And our standing in the world has been been diminished,  which impacts our brand economically."
01/08/23 9:31,I agree,5e1e5c3c80e02e1c36679187,Remain,"I don't suppose it helped.  Membership of the EU meant that if you imported goods from outside the EU that you could have got within it you had to pay a fine, so Brexit is a long-term bet that in 20 years trade with the Far East will be more important than trade with Europe.  It was bound to cause s0ome problems in the short term, and we won't know how it pans out for at least 15 years.  But it's dwarfed by the problems caused by the pandemic, and by the war in Ukraine."
01/08/23 9:32,I agree,60b1a04c994989b684e3dcfe,Leave,"In a nutshell, the current economic state of the UK has been caused by inept, corrupt, self serving politicians. Brexit is just ONE of the reasons were are in this mess. Unrestricted and illegal immigration is another major problem.The biggest scandal of all has been the Covid pandemic that was deliberately manufactured and set upon the world to create chaos. It most certainly did its job. The world is being run by the World Economic Forum and anyone who thinks differently is a fool. ""Build Back Better"" will benefit ONLY the multi billionaires who are running this evil show and they havent finished with us yet!!."
01/08/23 9:32,I agree,55848744fdf99b574f55ada0,Leave,"I don't think that the current economic condition of the United Kingdom has anything to do with Brexit, although that is just guesswork on my part as I don't really know. I think the current economic condition of the UK is not really current at all. I think the UK has been running a debt economy for a long time. The economics of the UK haven't made sense to me for decades. The cost of housing in any format is completely unreflective of wages, and we seem to have a government who has no clue about how the majority live, or simply doesn't care. What ever economic effects Brexit has had seem minimal in the grand scope of things."
01/08/23 9:33,I agree,5afcbf18fabc8900018854d9,Remain,Brexit has been a disaster. It has made it more expensive to import goods from Europe as well as making it harder to export to Europe. It has caused us to lose a lot of European workers meaning farmers have been unable to harvest crops making the products mor expensive to buy.
01/08/23 9:33,I agree,5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,Remain,"My opinion is that the economy has worsened due to Brexit. Most economists believe Brexit will worsen the economy and this is backed up by data from the CER that shows trade has been reduced by 7% since Brexit. This stands to reason because the UK doesn't enjoy the discounted rates for trading that were available while it was part of the EU, and this also increased taxes in the UK. Also the British pound has suffered too. Even taking into account the cost of EU membership, it was more financially beneficial for the UK to have been an EU member. This is what I predicted during the EU referendum but unfortunately, most voters were not capable of realising this."
01/09/23 23:22,I agree,63ac523fa1e81c35b1e7b890,Leave,I think the current economic position has been exacerbated not entirely caused by Brexit.  There were always going to be difficulties inputting new regimes.  Better preparation would have helped as it was obvious to me there may be a close vote. What could not be factored in are the complications of an economic down turn from a pandemic and then the fallout from the Ukraine war.  Even had we remained in The Union there would have been complications as member states had differing ideas about the war.  It seems that the world is growing more insular and it may have been better to join the trend at the start.  The young seem to feel part of Europe and they still can be but on different terms.
01/08/23 9:38,I agree,5e2321e4cf445f5d84c16968,Remain,It is absolutely caused by Brexit. Our energy bills are four times more than they are on mainland Europe. Many industries in the UK are struggling to recruit staff as freddom of movement has stopped. Exports and imports are down because of new red tape since we left the common market. Companies are moving to within the EU because the trading market is so much bigger. We are spending huge sums of money to keep immigration down because we have shut down all legal routes to claim asylam because our borders have become more strict. Brexit is hugely to blame for our terrible economy.
01/09/23 23:18,I agree,5b829ac542c9a8000170be84,Leave,It's not causes by Brexit just a incompetent tory government. This along with the pandemic and then global crisis following this and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused a unprecendent  situation . This has all been worsened by a government who are by far the worse government for a couple of decades. 
01/09/23 23:19,I agree,598dd5523694eb0001b81e14,Leave,The economic situation is partly due to brexit but mostly down to the pandemic which has resulted in trade deals etc not being implemented yet . Then we  also have the war in Ukraine which has pushed up energy prices.
01/08/23 9:42,I agree,61756116f3525bd231e96e14,Remain,I think Brexit definitely had and has a part in it. It would be interesting to know though how much of the current situation was known to it’s supporters. Both in Parliament and the general public. Having said that it’s hard to say if we’d be better off had we stayed.
01/08/23 9:48,I agree,5cefd79bc37f4f0018de98da,Remain,Brexit is the worst thing to happen to the UK in years. England Forced Scotland out of the EU and now we are suffering. The entire country is in shambles now. I have no respect at all for the political system or England in general. The tories are absolute scum. Vote independence and lets leave England to destroy themselves. 
01/08/23 9:49,I agree,6321292a23a6ebce8db47d93,Leave,"Potentially part of the poor current economic condition of the UK could have been caused from Brexit - namely due to the restriction of free movement leading to reduction in workers and people purchasing. COVID would have also played a part in lack of workers. The rest of the causes are most likely due to the UK economic policy. With that being said, a large number of EU countries are predicted to have a recession this coming year so it appears to be larger than just the UK."
01/08/23 9:49,I agree,5c00043a6d931200019bcb9b,Remain,"There is less of everything, also everything is now much, Much more expensive, and now I hear that most people want us to return back to the EU, I honestly believe that this has been the worst decision by the government that I have ever seen since I have been alive, the thing that really get to me is this was so obvious how could they not see that this was going to happen, this was definitely thinking the grass is greener on the other side except there was no other side, just us, all alone, they really thought the pound wold get stronger? and that everyone would buy from us? Ridiculous!. The experiment has failed & we must return to the EU ASAP!."
01/08/23 9:55,I agree,5ed93031e5e1620ec088366e,Remain,"The current UK economic condition is certainly influenced by Brexit. However, Brexit is also a symptom of a wider malaise in UK political, social and economic thinking. Brexit is a gigantic act of self-harm inflicted by uncomprehending voters who hoped for easy solutions to complicated problems, including things that were never really problems related to the European Union but were mis-described by the media and politicians for decades. Brexit has made trade more difficult and has weakened our position as a global and regional power. Many of our problems, however, are caused primarily by our self-defeating insistence on opening up state assets to the free market - except not even the free market as we would understand it, but a world of dodgy backhanders where failing privatised businesses are propped up by the taxpayer. Profits are privatised and losses are socialised. Our system has many perverse incentives for bad faith actors to cause economic harm to the country in exchange for short-term personal rewards - an example was the whole debacle around the Liz Truss economic plan."
01/08/23 10:20,I agree,5b7bf6c98c721a00015d1feb,Leave,"leaving was allways going to cause problems, however this has been massively made worse by other factors such as covid and the war in ukraine."
01/09/23 23:12,I agree,5fde5289cad6ac5ac1cda255,Leave,"I don’t think the things that are happening are entirely caused by Brexit, there’s definitely other factors such as having multiple different government teams over the last few years. Other things have also affected the economy such as the unfortunate war in Ukraine and covid. There’s so much that need to be done in this country to rectify the damage of the economy, being a stand alone means we should be able to fix things easily instead of relying on others. I blame our government & their lack of knowledge on situations. "
