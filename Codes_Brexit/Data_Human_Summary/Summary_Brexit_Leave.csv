All of which have nothing to do with Brexit. Businesses are finding it more difficult to import goods which is adding to costs. There is less of everything, also everything is now much, Much more expensive. The cost of housing in any format is completely unreflective of wages, and we seem to have a government who has no clue about how the majority live, or simply doesn't care.

We can make Brexit a success we just need the Government to grow some balls and get on with it.",Leave

There have been many factors that have contributed to the economic condition. Global pandemic, poor government decision making has played a part. The Russian/Ukraine war saw gas prices increase. All of which have nothing to do with Brexit.I don’t think the things that are happening are entirely caused by Brexit, there’s definitely other factors such as having multiple different government teams over the last few years. There’s so much that need to be done in this country to rectify the damage of the economy, being a stand alone means we should be able to fix things easily instead of relying on others. Covid had a huge unpack on our economy and so have the changing of our priminister.",Leave
