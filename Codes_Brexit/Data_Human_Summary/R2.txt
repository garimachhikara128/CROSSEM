I don't think the conditions can be blamed solely on Brexit as there's also effects from the Ukranian war and COVID, but Brexit weakened our economy at a critical time which has severely diminished our ability to trade internationally and to borrow from other nations

It is not all due to Brexit however, the current Conservative government has handled the economy very poorly ensuring those a the top are cared for whilst those at the middle and bottom are left to fend for themselves

There have been many factors that have contributed to the economic condition

Global pandemic, poor government decision making has played a part

The Russian/Ukraine war saw gas prices increase

I don't believe that the current economic woes are caused *solely* by BREXIT, but it did play a large part

Certainly our being apart from Europe has impacted us financially and in other, less tangible yet more far-reaching ways

It is certainly not helping,  Businesses are finding it more difficult to import goods which is adding to costs
