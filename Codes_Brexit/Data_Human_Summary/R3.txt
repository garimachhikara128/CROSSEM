The current UK economic condition is certainly influenced by Brexit

However, Brexit is also a symptom of a wider malaise in UK political, social and economic thinking

Brexit is a gigantic act of self-harm inflicted by uncomprehending voters who hoped for easy solutions to complicated problems, including things that were never really problems related to the European Union but were mis-described by the media and politicians for decades

Brexit is the worst thing to happen to the UK in years

In a nutshell, the current economic state of the UK has been caused by inept, corrupt, self serving politicians

Brexit is just ONE of the reasons were are in this mess

We've lost our biggest trading partner because of the ideological blindness of a party of populists

The tories are absolute scum

We were stronger together

Brexit has been a disaster

There have been many factors that have contributed to the economic condition

Global pandemic, poor government decision making has played a part

The Russian/Ukraine war saw gas prices increase

All of which have nothing to do with Brexit

The experiment has failed & we must return to the EU ASAP!
