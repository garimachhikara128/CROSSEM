Global pandemic, poor government decision making has played a part

The Russian/Ukraine war saw gas prices increase

Brexit has meant many things in our economy has changed and itâ€™s made life a lot harder for many

The cost of housing in any format is completely unreflective of wages, and we seem to have a government who has no clue about how the majority live, or simply doesn't care

The economic situation is partly due to brexit but mostly down to the pandemic which has resulted in trade deals etc not being implemented yet
