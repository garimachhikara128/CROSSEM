Other things have also affected the economy such as the unfortunate war in Ukraine and covid

Thereâ€™s so much that need to be done in this country to rectify the damage of the economy, being a stand alone means we should be able to fix things easily instead of relying on others

I blame our government & their lack of knowledge on situations

Brexit has been a disaster

It has made it more expensive to import goods from Europe as well as making it harder to export to Europe

The economics of the UK haven't made sense to me for decades

The cost of housing in any format is completely unreflective of wages, and we seem to have a government who has no clue about how the majority live, or simply doesn't care

What ever economic effects Brexit has had seem minimal in the grand scope of things

Also, the cost of goods has increased and we simply are having to pay more for goods from European countries due to tariffs that are in place
