Global pandemic, poor government decision making has played a part

The Russian/Ukraine war saw gas prices increase

All of which have nothing to do with Brexit

The cost of housing in any format is completely unreflective of wages, and we seem to have a government who has no clue about how the majority live, or simply doesn't care

Even had we remained in The Union there would have been complications as member states had differing ideas about the war

We can make Brexit a success we just need the Government to grow some balls and get on with it
