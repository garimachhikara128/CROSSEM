I dont believe that the country has made the best of Brexit yet

Although some of it may have been caused by Brexit I don’t think it can be said the current economic condition is solely because of Brexit

There have been many factors that have contributed to the economic condition

Global pandemic, poor government decision making has played a part

The Russian/Ukraine war saw gas prices increase

All of which have nothing to do with Brexit

I don’t think the things that are happening are entirely caused by Brexit, there’s definitely other factors such as having multiple different government teams over the last few years

There’s so much that need to be done in this country to rectify the damage of the economy, being a stand alone means we should be able to fix things easily instead of relying on others

Covid had a huge unpack on our economy and so have the changing of our priminister
