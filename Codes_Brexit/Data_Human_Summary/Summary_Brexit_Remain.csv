Thereâ€™s so much that need to be done in this country to rectify the damage of the economy, being a stand alone means we should be able to fix things easily instead of relying on others. I blame our government & their lack of knowledge on situations. Brexit has been a disaster. It has made it more expensive to import goods from Europe as well as making it harder to export to Europe. The economics of the UK haven't made sense to me for decades. The cost of housing in any format is completely unreflective of wages, and we seem to have a government who has no clue about how the majority live, or simply doesn't care. What ever economic effects Brexit has had seem minimal in the grand scope of things. Also, the cost of goods has increased and we simply are having to pay more for goods from European countries due to tariffs that are in place. ",Remain

It is not all due to Brexit however, the current Conservative government has handled the economy very poorly ensuring those a the top are cared for whilst those at the middle and bottom are left to fend for themselves. There have been many factors that have contributed to the economic condition. Global pandemic, poor government decision making has played a part. The Russian/Ukraine war saw gas prices increase. I don't believe that the current economic woes are caused *solely* by BREXIT, but it did play a large part. Certainly our being apart from Europe has impacted us financially and in other, less tangible yet more far-reaching ways. It is certainly not helping, Businesses are finding it more difficult to import goods which is adding to costs.",Remain

However, Brexit is also a symptom of a wider malaise in UK political, social and economic thinking. Brexit is a gigantic act of self-harm inflicted by uncomprehending voters who hoped for easy solutions to complicated problems, including things that were never really problems related to the European Union but were mis-described by the media and politicians for decades. Brexit is the worst thing to happen to the UK in years. In a nutshell, the current economic state of the UK has been caused by inept, corrupt, self serving politicians. Brexit is just ONE of the reasons were are in this mess. We've lost our biggest trading partner because of the ideological blindness of a party of populists. The tories are absolute scum. We were stronger together. Brexit has been a disaster. There have been many factors that have contributed to the economic condition. Global pandemic, poor government decision making has played a part. The Russian/Ukraine war saw gas prices increase. All of which have nothing to do with Brexit. incompetent tory government. The experiment has failed & we must return to the EU ASAP!.",Remain
