Some companies select equally deserving females over males. If a female is competing against a male with a similar skill set then she may have a slight advantage.

I think in the name of Gender equality, unfair advantage is given to female candidates in a lot of fields.

Giving preference to female candidates is wrong as it disregards the fundamental principle of gender equality.
