Yes,I think so as if they find both male and female have almost equal skills then they prefer hiring a female to maintain the ratio of males and females in their organisation.

Yeah they obviously do, they call it diversity hiring to encourage career in engineering for women but due to that many other deserving and skilled candidates don't get selected which a serious issue.

Yes, it's fair because many female didn't get chance .

However, companies that come for female-only hiring is a bit too u fair in my opinion.
