Yes,I think so as if they find both male and female have almost equal skills then they prefer hiring a female to maintain the ratio of males and females in their organisation.

No, I don't think so companies prefer hiring female over male during oncampus recruitment.

But it disappoints men who do the hardwork day and night to get better on-campus placements.

During the on-campus recruitments, I have just observed that companies hire the people that fits into their requirement criteria for the job.
