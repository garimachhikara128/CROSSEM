Yes, companies do prefer female candidates over male or as they say diversity hiring which in turns leads to unfairness as in campuses like in mine male to female ratio is 15:1 which creates a further poor impact on placement drive as male candidates often fail to land up in good companies and due to this the ratio of 15:1 changes to 60:40 in corporate sector.

The companies don't prefer hiring females over males it is just that they have some seats for females which doesn't mean that males are not hired which provide a bit greater opportunities to girls although the questions asked in interviews and test everything stands same for both males and females and the females hired are equally competent since the procedure is same for both males and females.

During the first rounds of assesments I think sometimes (rarely) some companies select equal number of male and female candidates for further rounds, in such cases I think it's unfair for the male candidates since the number of males are more, but after the further rounds they only recruit the ones perfectly fit for the job on the basis of talent regardless of their gender.

Yes of course they do, 1 Adobe only take female candidates- although it is not mentioned that only female candidates will be chosen but during on campus placement they only short list girl students, 2 Google Step internship- only for women internship, 3 De shaw also give one of it's internship to girls only.
