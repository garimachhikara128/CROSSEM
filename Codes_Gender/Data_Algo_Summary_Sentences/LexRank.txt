Yes,I think so as if they find both male and female have almost equal skills then they prefer hiring a female to maintain the ratio of males and females in their organisation.

I do not think that companies prefer hiring female over male.

Yes, This is not fair in my opinion because companies should recruit the students on the basis of their talent  and skills.

Only some companies prefer doing so,they don't prefer girls over boys but both girls and boys equally in 1:1, This is fair because they do so to maintain gender diversity.
