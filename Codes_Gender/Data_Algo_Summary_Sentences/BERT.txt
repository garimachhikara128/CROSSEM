Yes,I think so as if they find both male and female have almost equal skills then they prefer hiring a female to maintain the ratio of males and females in their organisation.

During the first rounds of assesments I think sometimes (rarely) some companies select equal number of male and female candidates for further rounds, in such cases I think it's unfair for the male candidates since the number of males are more, but after the further rounds they only recruit the ones perfectly fit for the job on the basis of talent regardless of their gender.

No, most companies prefer both, They are selected based on their performance and skills.

Yeah they obviously do, they call it diversity hiring to encourage career in engineering for women but due to that many other deserving and skilled candidates don't get selected which a serious issue.
