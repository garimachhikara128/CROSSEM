The companies don't prefer hiring females over males it is just that they have some seats for females which doesn't mean that males are not hired which provide a bit greater opportunities to girls although the questions asked in interviews and test everything stands same for both males and females and the females hired are equally competent since the procedure is same for both males and females.

Yes this happens especially in case of Microsoft like recently with Microsoft engage program.

Boys and all other genders are equally eligible for the same positions also they can even work/perform better than girls in many situations so this should be considered for a change.

Just like apple only recruits a girl student every year and so with Google and Adobe.
