However, some companies are discriminatory and want to recruit more females than males, which is not fair.

Companies do prefer female candidates over male or as they say diversity hiring which in turns leads to unfairness as in campuses like in mine male to female ratio is 15:1 which creates a further poor impact on placement drive as male candidates often fail to land up in good companies and due to this the ratio of 15:1 changes to 60:40 in corporate sector.

Companies prefer women which results in demotivation and inequality among all students .

I think females are given an edge over male during on-campus recruitment under the banner of women empowerment to showcase a rise in female participation.
