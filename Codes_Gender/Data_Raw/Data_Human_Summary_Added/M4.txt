But it disappoints men who do the hardwork day and night to get better on-campus placements.

Companies look for overall talent in a candidate but gender diversity of a firm also plays a huge role nowadays so whenever there is a clash of seat between equally eligible male and female candidates the latter is generally given preference to.

I personally think it is not fair to do so because a lot of eligible candidates loose there moral and confidence after being rejected because of gender based hiring.

Yeah they obviously do, they call it diversity hiring to encourage career in engineering for women but due to that many other deserving and skilled candidates don't get selected which a serious issue.
