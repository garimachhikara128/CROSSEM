This may be good in sense that female unemployment can be decreased and they have their own job that they don't need to depend on male's money. 

Any company tries to maintain a balance between its male and female workforce and  they  hire female candidate only when they have required skillsets.

Gender equality in the workplace is important not only because it is "fair" and "the right thing to do," but also because it is linked to a country's overall economic performance. 

However, to promote female candidates some companies sometimes start recruitment drive that is only for female.
