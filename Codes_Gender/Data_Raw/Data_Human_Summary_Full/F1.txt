Company prefer the qualified students. But yes in some case, they prefer female over male but in rare case only if both have equal abilities. This may be good in sense that female unemployment can be decreased and they have their own job that they don't need to depend on male's money. But might not be fair for male one, because they also have their family and dream to be fulfilled. 

To some extend it is a good way to ensure that female candidates get hired. However, companies that come for female-only hiring is a bit too u fair in my opinion.
