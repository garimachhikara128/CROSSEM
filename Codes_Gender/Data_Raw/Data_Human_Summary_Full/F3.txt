I don't think this is a correct statement. Any company tries to maintain a balance between its male and female workforce. We can obviously crack jokes regarding a company preferring a female candidate, but in reality, I find no logical reason to think a company would feel a need to give preference to female candidates.

The companies don't prefer hiring females over males it is just that they have some seats for females which doesn't mean that males are not hired which provide a bit greater opportunities to girls although the questions asked in interviews and test everything stands same for both males and females and the females hired are equally competent since the procedure is same for both males and females.
