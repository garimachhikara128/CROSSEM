Not all companies prefer hiring females over males during on-campus recruitment. But some companies select equally deserving females over males. It is not that any female candidate is selected without focusing on her skills. Instead, only if she is competing against a male with similar skill set then she may have a slight advantage. 

I think in the name of Gender equality, unfair advantage is given to female candidates in a lot of fields. Though this advantage was necessary in the past when opportunities were less, but nowadays everyone has a lot of opportunities. Giving preference to female candidates is wrong as is disregards the fundamental principle of gender equality.
