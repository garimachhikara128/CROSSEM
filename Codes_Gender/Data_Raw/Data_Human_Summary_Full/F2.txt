The companies don't prefer hiring females over males it is just that they have some seats for females which doesn't mean that males are not hired which provide a bit greater opportunities to girls although the questions asked in interviews and test everything stands same for both males and females and the females hired are equally competent since the procedure is same for both males and females.

Companies usually don't do any discrimination. However, to promote female candidates some companies sometimes start recruitment drives that are only for females.
